NotGoingToDoIt now has the ability to share posts with Facebook.

To share a post you must save it as &#8220;Public&#8221;.  Then in the list of posts you can click on the Facebook share button.  NotGoingToDoIt will not post anything to Facebook without your knowledge.

If you make a post Public, it will also end up in the [Recent Posts Feed](https://app.ngtdi.com/recentfeed).  This list contains the Period of Time, and the AntiResolution.  It does not include your username or specific dates.
